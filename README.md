# odin-recipes

A project that contains recipes. 

It makes use of the HTML skills learned so far in The Odin Project, including elements and styling.

Looking back on this project, I have learned how to use text tags, paragraphs, anchor tags, images, styling such as bold and italics, ordered and unordered lists, headings, and how to commit incrementally with git as well as push an entire project to GitHub.
